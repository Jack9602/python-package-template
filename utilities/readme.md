# Utilities
Each File/Module will have a heading with useful information within it. For General project info please see the readme found in the root of this project.

## module.py

### Testing
*Include information for developers about how to test the code. A good implementation for this would be to have people run the file directly ```python3 example.py``` and have this set off a:*
```Python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    do tests
```


### Usage
*give a quickstart to the module, you could include the primary function(s) that achieve the intended functionality* 

### Development guide
*write information that may be useful to expanding/iterating on the module*.

#### Dependencies
*Although all dependencies are generally listed in the main readme, having an idea of what is being used on each module without having to navigate into it from the github page is helpful*
